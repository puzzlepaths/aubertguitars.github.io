	<h3 class="faq-h3">How do I play the game?</h3>
	<p class="faq-p">Puzzle Paths is a downloadable outdoor adventure game. Once you checkout on this website, you'll instantly receive your game pack via download. It will also be sent to your email address so you always have a copy. You can print it off at your own convenience and then you'll be ready to play. </p>
	<h3 class="faq-h3">What if I don't have access to a printer?</h3>
	<p class="faq-p">We do recommend printing it off if you can as it'll be easier to share and make notes. However, you can view the game on a tablet. You can either use an app that allows annotations or you can bring along a blank piece of paper and a pen to record your progress. We do not recommending using a smartphone as the small screen size will make it awkward. </p>
	<h3 class="faq-h3">Do I need to buy a copy for each player?</h3>
	<p class="faq-p">No, one of the great things is that you only need to buy one copy. You can then share the game pack amongst your group or print off multiple copies.</p>
	<h3 class="faq-h3">Is it suitable for children?</h3>
	<p class="faq-p">Absolutely. Children from ages 6+ will enjoy the game, and even if younger children won't follow along entirely, they'll certainly have fun seeing new and exciting parts of the city. </p>
	<h3 class="faq-h3">Is the route suitable for buggies?</h3>
	<p class="faq-p">The route is set along paths but does involve two sets of stairs. If you're able to navigate stairs then you should be fine.</p>
	<h3 class="faq-h3">Is the route dog-friendly?</h3>
	<p class="faq-p">The route is suitable for most dogs. It will take you to places such as the Royal Crescent and Victoria Park which your dog will surely love! So long as your dog can manage stairs and the busier area around the Abbey, then you'll be ok. </p>
	<h3 class="faq-h3">What time does it start?</h3>
	<p class="faq-p">Almost any time you want. It's self-paced which means you have complete control over when you begin, how long you spend and when you finish. Take breaks when you fancy and feel free to take detours if something catches your eye. It's up to you. Just make sure there's enough daylight! </p>
	<h3 class="faq-h3">Does it have to be played on specific days?</h3>
	<p class="faq-p">The route has been designed to work on any day of the week. Please do check ahead for potential clashes with large events that may interfere with getting around town, e.g. the Bath Half Marathon. </p>
	<h3 class="faq-h3">What if there is something blocking the route? </h3>
	<p class="faq-p">Unfortunately we can't anticipate things like sudden road closures or police activity that may disrupt the route. In these cases, please do your best to navigate around and continue on your way. If there is a major problem with the route, please contact us at hello.puzzlepaths@gmail.com </p>

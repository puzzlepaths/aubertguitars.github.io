		<p class="about-text-2-p">"My aim is to provide a friendly and efficient guitar repair service. Every guitar is different and so is every guitar owner. I like my customers to drop by the workshop whenever they can and I am keen to discuss their requirements as much as is necessary to achieve complete satisfaction. All customers are welcome to come back anytime to make further adjustments if needed. I am diligent in my work ethic and I stand by the fact that the hands on attention of a luthier can realise the potential of an instrument in ways that factories simply cannot hope to achieve."<br><br>

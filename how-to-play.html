    		<h3 class="how-to-play-h3">1. Purchase Your Game</h3>
			<p class="how-to-play-p">Simply <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/buy-now.html">click here to buy your game</a>. After paying online, you'll instantly receive the downloadable game pack. It will also be emailed to you for safekeeping so you always have a copy of it.    </p>
    		<h3 class="how-to-play-h3">2. Print it Off</h3>
			<p class="how-to-play-p">Whenever you're ready, print the game off and you'll be ready to go. You can also view it on a tablet device. We advise against using a smartphone as the screen size will make things awkward. It's recommended to print it off as it's easier to make notes and share amongst a group!  </p>
    		<h3 class="how-to-play-h3">3. Head to the Starting Point</h3>
			<p class="how-to-play-p">You can start solving the puzzle whenever you're ready. So long as there's daylight, there are no restrictions! The game lasts 2-4 hours so it's great for both a morning or afternoon activity. The starting point is none other than Bath Abbey, right in the middle of the city.  </p>
    		<h3 class="how-to-play-h3">4. Start Solving!</h3>
			<p class="how-to-play-p">All you need are suitable clothes and shoes for walking around town. Don't worry - the route will be along paths and won't require you to walk in muddy terrain. Grab your case files, a pen, put on your thinking cap and you're all set! </p>

		<p class="about-text-2-p">"My aim is to provide a friendly and efficient guitar repair service. Every guitar is different and so is every guitar owner. I like my customers to drop by the workshop whenever they can and I am keen to discuss their requirements as much as is necessary to achieve complete satisfaction. All customers are welcome to come back anytime to make further adjustments if needed. I am diligent in my work ethic and I stand by the fact that the hands on attention of a luthier can realise the potential of an instrument in ways that factories simply cannot hope to achieve."<br><br>

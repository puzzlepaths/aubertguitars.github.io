				<p class="work-description">This is a full stack web application that helps app developers market their products by improving their app store optimisation (ASO). The idea is that in 60 seconds, they can get a report identifying their underperforming keywords. It's live and available to try at the URL below. There's also a technical writeup about the project <a href="https://medium.com/@gregaubs/the-one-week-startup-pt-2-shipping-the-product-a39477d2242a" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

				<h4 class="work-h4">Google Analytics API App</h4>
				<p class="work-description">This app makes use of Google Apps Script. It's a tool for anybody who uses Google Analytics extensively. GA is great if you know the right questions to ask it. But what if GA could process the data and tell you useful things automatically without needing to be asked? This first version keeps answering the simple question, "on this day, was anything out of the ordinary with my site?" I will make it available for others to use on their own GA accounts soon.</p>

				<h4 class="work-h4">Silverman Razors</h4>
				<p class="work-description">I really like ecommerce, and creating this store was good fun. It is built on the Shopify platform with a fair amount of custom work done on the theme. It was good to improve my basic Photoshop skills by producing the logo, graphics and doing retouching for the product photos.</p>

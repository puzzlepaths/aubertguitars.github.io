		<p>Arthurâ€™s various career paths in science, electronics and engineering finally merged into a lifetime of working with wood. He brings these varied experiences and skills to the world of guitar repair. The physics of sound, circuits and pick ups, the engineering of structure and the resonance of wood. These all feature at some point in the building and repair of guitars, electric or acoustic.</p>

		<p class="about-text-2-p">"My aim is to provide a friendly and efficient guitar repair service. Every guitar is different and so is every guitar owner. I like my customers to drop by the workshop whenever they can and I am keen to discuss their requirements as much as is necessary to achieve complete satisfaction. All customers are welcome to come back anytime to make further adjustments if needed. I am diligent in my work ethic and I stand by the fact that the hands on attention of a luthier can realise the potential of an instrument in ways that factories simply cannot hope to achieve."<br><br>
